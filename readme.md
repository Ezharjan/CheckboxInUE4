# Check box for UE4



_UnityLikeGameObjectActivationCheckboxInUE_



This project is going to make a Unity-Like GameObject Activation checkbox in Unreal Engine 4.

All the codes are too simple to make separate tutorial  for it.

You can even directly add the relevant property in engine root ---> Actor.h to use it globally.

But I did not do that, if you achieved it, don't hesitate to share with me!
